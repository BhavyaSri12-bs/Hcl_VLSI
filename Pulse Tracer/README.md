Pulse Tracer is a Verilog hardware module designed to detect and highlight pulses in a digital input signal. It identifies both rising edges and falling edges, generating corresponding output pulses for each type of event. This makes it useful in timing analysis, event detection, and digital signal monitoring applications.

ðŸ”§ Features
Detects rising edges (0 â†’ 1 transitions)

Detects falling edges (1 â†’ 0 transitions)

Generates clean singleâ€‘clock pulses for each edge

Simple and lightweight design suitable for FPGA and ASIC use

Testbench included for quick verification

 Use Cases
Digital signal monitoring and debugging

Clock or data edge detection

Trigger generation for logic analyzers

Event counters and measurement systems
