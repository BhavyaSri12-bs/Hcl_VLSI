The Edge Highlighter is a digital circuit that detects and marks rising edges or falling edges of an input signal.
It generates a short pulse (1 clock cycle) when a transition occurs, which is useful for:

1.Button debouncing
2.Triggering counters or FSMs on input changes
3.Capturing events in digital systems

This repository includes:

1.RTL design files (Verilog/SystemVerilog)
2.Testbench files to verify functionality
3.Instructions to simulate and view waveforms
