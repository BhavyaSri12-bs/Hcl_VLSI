The Nibble Swapper is a simple digital logic project that swaps the higher and lower 4‑bit sections (nibbles) of an 8‑bit binary number. It is a useful tool for understanding bit manipulation, digital design concepts, and data reordering in microcontrollers and digital circuits.

Features:
Accepts 8‑bit binary input

Swaps upper (bits 7–4) and lower (bits 3–0) nibbles

Outputs the swapped 8‑bit result

Easy to implement in hardware description languages or embedded system
Use Cases:
Learning bitwise operations

Digital electronics practice

Data manipulation in microcontrollers

Preprocessing data in communication systems

Target: Works in both simulation and FPGA/microcontroller implementations
