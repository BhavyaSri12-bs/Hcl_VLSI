The Gray Code Converter is a digital logic project that converts between Binary Code and Gray Code. Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit, making it highly useful in error minimization, digital communication, and encoder design.

Features:
Converts an N-bit Binary input to its corresponding Gray Code

Converts Gray Code input back to Binary (if included in your design)

Simple, modular design for easy understanding and modification

Can be simulated on digital design platforms or implemented on FPGA/ASIC
