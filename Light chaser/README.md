The Light Chaser is a digital logic project that creates a sequential running LED effect, where a pattern of lights “chases” across multiple LEDs. This project demonstrates the use of sequential circuits, counters, and shift registers, making it an excellent learning tool for beginners in digital electronics and FPGA design.

Features:
Sequential LED lighting effect (left to right / right to left)

Adjustable speed using clock dividers

Can be expanded for any number of LEDs

Compact and resource‑efficient design

Ideal for FPGA/CPLD, microcontroller boards, or breadboard implementations

Working Principle:
The Light Chaser works by:

Taking a clock input (from an oscillator or FPGA board).

Using a counter or shift register to generate sequential signals.

Driving the LEDs so they turn ON and OFF in a chasing pattern.
