The Even or Odd FSM is a digital design project that determines whether a given binary input sequence represents an even or odd number. It uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) approach, making it an excellent example for understanding state-based logic design and sequential circuits.

Features:
Detects if a binary sequence corresponds to an Even or Odd number

Designed using FSM principles (Moore/Mealy model – specify yours)

Works on serial bit input (stream of bits) or parallel input (8-bit, 16-bit, etc.)

Lightweight, efficient, and easy to simulate or implement on FPGA/ASIC

Working Principle:
The FSM has two states:

Even State (E): Indicates the sequence so far is even

Odd State (O): Indicates the sequence so far is odd

The machine starts in the Even state (assuming 0 as initial).

Each input bit updates the state.

After the final input, the FSM outputs whether the number is Even or Odd.
